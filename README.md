![](src/images/rag-stack.png)

Leveraging LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, this RAG system is designed to process data from files of varying formats. This system can ingest data from files, store them in a ChromaDB vector database, and be used to query them with precision thanks to LlamaIndexâ€™s retrieval tools.

The backend is a FastAPI server handling file upload and chat connection requests made from a Streamlit client app.
